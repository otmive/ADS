- exploring different models
	- git repos
	- trying to get vector representations
	- legacy code
	- m1 compatibility
	- old libraries incompatible
	- found YOLOv5
- Training dataset on YOLOv5
	- splitting classes into trtain/test
		- no val due to dataset size limits
	- resizing images
	- uploading to github
	- designing colab notebook
	- setting up CleaML for experiment logging
	- ran for several sets of epochs
	- pretrained on {dataset name} dataset using {model size} size of YOLOv5
- Extracting feature vectors
	- non-standard approach
	- manually extracted them from YOLOv5 code
	- Then stored with the relevant image in csv file
- Data visualization
	- First tried 3d
		- PCA
		- TSNE
		- These weren't great as they didn't represent the high demensional feature space very well
	- Closest vectors in euclidian space
	- Highest cosine similarity
	- top-1 and top-5 accuracy
	- we did a top-9 accuracy for our own initial observations
	- Subjective analysis of how well the vectors of various items of clothing aligned with the vectors nearest through manual image analysis
	- Train/Test loss graphs
